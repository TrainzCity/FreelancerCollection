## About project
[Freelancer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Freelancer_(video_game)) is a very interesting and beautiful arcade game about the space adventures of Edison Trent was released in 2003. The start of sales was successful, over the years the popularity of the game has acquired a large community. However, in 2010, Microsoft Corporation has stopped supporting official servers, and over the years of operation, not a single patch or DLC has been released.
The players have made quite a lot of mods and plugins, some of which are still supported, but the installation of some of them is too complicated and may end in errors. I decided to make a "Freelancer Collection" launcher, which will combine all the mods and language packs, making the installation more convenient.

## Why Open Source
Over the years, Freelancer's popularity has built a huge community around it. A huge number of mods, plugins and language packs for them have been written, hundreds of community servers have been created. There is a lot of content for the game and it is not possible to support the project alone. Each of you can take my developments and use them in your products. You can close the source code and sell solutions for money, but the original project will always be distributed free and MIT License.

## System Requirements
Supported operating systems: Windows XP - Windows 10. If you are using Windows XP, you need to install .NETFramework 4.0.3 on your system. The Freelancer game works great in Wine, [Valve Steam Proton](https://github.com/ValveSoftware/Proton) and [CrossOver](https://www.codeweavers.com/crossover/) (MacOS). You can also play Freelancer on [SteamDeck](https://www.steamdeck.com/en/).

## How it works
The application is written in the C# programming language using the WPF XAML graphical environment. The project is built on NET Framework 4.0.3 using Visual Studio.
